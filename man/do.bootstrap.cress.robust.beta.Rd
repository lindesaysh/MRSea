\usage{
do.bootstrap.cress.robust.beta(
  model.obj,
  predictionGrid,
  splineParams = NULL,
  g2k = NULL,
  B,
  robust = T,
  name = NULL,
  seed = 12345,
  nCores = 1,
  cat.message = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{model.obj}{The best fitting \code{CReSS} model for the original count data. Should be geeglm or a Poisson/Binomial GLM (not quasi).}

\item{predictionGrid}{The prediction grid data}

\item{splineParams}{The object describing the parameters for fitting the one and two dimensional splines}

\item{g2k}{(N x k) matrix of distances between all prediction points (N) and all knot points (k)}

\item{B}{Number of bootstrap iterations}

\item{name}{Analysis name. Required to avoid overwriting previous bootstrap results. This name is added at the beginning of "predictionboot.RData" when saving bootstrap predictions.}

\item{seed}{Set the seed for the bootstrap sampling process.}

\item{nCores}{Set the number of computer cores for the bootstrap process to use (default = 1).  The more cores the faster the proces but be wary of over using the cores on your computer. If \code{nCores} > (number of computer cores - 2), the function defaults to \code{nCores} = (number of computer cores - 2).  Note: On a Mac computer the parallel code does not compute so use nCores=1.}

\item{rename}{A vector of column names for which a new column needs to be created for the bootstrapped data. This defaults to \code{segment.id} for line transects (which is required for \code{create.bootcount.data}), others might be added.
A new column with new ids will automatically be created for the column listed in \code{resample}. In case of nearshore data, this argument is ignored.}
}
\value{
The function returns a matrix of bootstrap predictions. The number of rows is equal to the number of rows in predictionGrid.  The number of columns is equal to \code{B}.  The matrix may be very large and so is stored directly into the working directory as a workspace object: '"name"predictionboot.RObj'.  The object inside is called \code{bootPreds}.

\description{
\ifelse{html}{\href{https://lifecycle.r-lib.org/articles/stages.html#experimental}{\figure{lifecycle-experimental.svg}{options: alt='[Experimental]'}}}{\strong{[Experimental]}}

This fuction performs a specified number of bootstrapping iterations using CReSS/SALSA for fitting the count model. See below for details.
}
\details{
The following steps are performed for each iteration:
\itemize{
\item coefficients are resampled from a multivariate normal distribution defined by MLE and COV from the best fitting count model
\item predictions are made to the prediction data using the resampled coefficients
}
}
