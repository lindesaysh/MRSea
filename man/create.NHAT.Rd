\title{Estimated number of individuals for each detection}
\usage{
create.NHAT(data, ddf.obj)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{distance data object used with \code{det.fct} to estimate probabilities of detection}

\item{ddf.obj}{detection function object created by \code{ddf}}
}
\description{
This function creates a new column in \code{data} which contains the estimated
number of animals for each detection. This is the number of observed individuals
divided by their probability of detection using MCDS methods (size/detection probability).
In the case that no \code{size} column is given in \code{dis.data}, it is assumed that
detections were made of individuals and \code{size} is set to 1 for all detections. The values
for \code{size} and \code{NHAT} are set to zero in case the distance was larger than the
truncation distance \code{w} specified in \code{det.fct.object}.
In addition, a new column \code{area} is created which is used as the offset in the
second stage count model (segment length * (truncation distance/1000) * 2). The truncation
distance is divided by 1000 to convert it from metres to km. It is assumed that the
segment data represents two-sided surveys. In case the survey was one-sided, this column needs to
be divided by 2 after the call to this function.
