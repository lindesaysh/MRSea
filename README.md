# MRSea

The latest stable version is **1.5** (10/12/2023)

The latest development version is on the Master branch.

The [MRSea](https://lindesaysh.github.io/MRSea) packages allows the
fitting of **spatially adaptive regression splines using SALSA**.

It was developed to examine animal survey data for signs of changes in
animal abundance and distribution following marine renewables
development. However the methods are suitable for a wide range of
applications.

The functions of this package can be used to analyse segmented line
transect (alongside the `mrds` package) or digital aerial data. The
package includes functions for fitting spatially adaptive one and 2D
smoothers using SALSA and CReSS. Euclidean or Geodesic distances can be
used to underpin the smoothed 2D surface and a choice of Gaussian or
exponential radial basis functions are available. Non-parametric
bootstrapping is available to estimate uncertainty. Several model
assessment tools are also available. For models with residual
correlation, direct estimation of robust standard errors, given a panel
structure, is available.

Recent updates include the reinstatement of natural cubic splines, the Tweedie 
distribution and a package website with additional materials.

## Installation

You can install the latest bugfix release of MRSea from
[GitHub](https://github.com/lindesaysh/MRSea) with:

``` r

latest release

## Documentation

There are two “Getting Started” vignettes available with the package:

- Getting Started with MRSea: One dimensional smoothing
- Getting Started with MRSea: Two dimensional smoothing

These are also on the
[website](https://lindesaysh.github.io/MRSea/articles) along with a
number of other tutorials.
