Title: Spatially adaptive regression splines using SALSA - Point Process models
Description: Examines animal survey data for signs of changes in animal
    abundance and distribution following marine renewables development. The
	functions of this package can be used to analyse many types of data including
    segmented line transect data and nearshore vantage point data. 
    The package fits Generalised Additive Models (GAMs) to one and two dimensional splines/bases
    utilising a spatially adaptive framework for knot number and location. In one dimension, B-splines, 
    cyclic cubics and natural cubics are available and in two dimensions, the radial bases can be Gaussian or
    exponential and use Euclidean or Geodesic (or other user specified) distances. Non-parametric
    bootstrapping is available to estimate uncertainty and if residual correlation is present, robust standard
    errors maybe used (given a panel structure). Several model assessment
    tools are also available. .
